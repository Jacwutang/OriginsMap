# [Live Demo](https://jacwutang.github.io/OriginsMap/)

The goal of this project is to track the origins of every NFL football player from 1960s. Of significant importance is the overall trend of where football players come from over a period of time. Do certain regions/states produce more football players? Are certain counties a hotspot for the next generation of talent?
